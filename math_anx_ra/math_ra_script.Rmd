# 
# # rename cols
# colnames(assessments)[1] <- "study.ID"
# colnames(assessments)[2] <- "lab.ID"
# 
# # remove "AG_" before sub num (1st col of assessments)
# assessments$study.ID <- gsub("^.{0,3}", "", assessments$study.ID)

# use only subs for whom we have assessments and alphas
assess.use <- read.csv('aging_assessments_use.csv')
alphas.use <- read.csv('mon_alphas_use.csv') 

# check colnames
colnames(assess.use)
colnames(assess.use)[1] <- "study.ID"
colnames(assess.use)[2] <- "lab.ID"
